        <item><b>The Dodgers World Series-clinching 3-1 victory in Game 6 had a
        little bit of everything, from Randy Arozarena capping his historic postseason with yet another
        home run to World Series MVP Corey Seager knocking in the go-ahead run to Mookie Betts once again impacting the game with both his legs and his bat.
            <p>But the moment that had players from across Major League Baseball(and even other professional sports) taking to
                social media was Rays manager Kevin Cashs decision to remove starter Blake Snell after 5 1/3 innings and 73 pitches.Debate:
                Any defense of pulling Snell in G6?While some fellow big league pitchers simply empathized with Snells frustrations,
                many questioned Cash rationale for removing his starter -- perhaps none more than 2009 World Series champion and FOX broadcaster Alex Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>Plenty of other pitchers seemed to agree. White Sox ace Lucas Giolito tweeted: "Can not believe they pull him here" with a skull emoji. Mariners left-hander Marco Gonzales added: "Damn why take him out?!?! Wow." His former teammate and impending free agent Taijuan Walker echoed a similar sentiment, tweeting: "73 pitches... I am hella mad for him" with a series of angry-face emojis. Zack Britton reaction? A simple shrug emoji.
            Dallas Keuchel, who won the 2015 AL Cy Young Award and the 17 World Series with the Astros, tweeted: "How you going to pull your #1 starter in that situation? Smh."
            Veteran reliever Jerry Blevins, who has 13 years of big league experience, also questioned the analytical side of the decision, tweeting: "Imagine you just lost the World Series on a decision to pull or leave-in your pitcher. You are sitting in front of a room full of reporters about to ask you why did it. Analytics say... or I thought... are your 2 options. Which is easier to defend?"
            Cardinals ace Jack Flaherty simply let a GIF do the talking -- and Syndergaard replied with one of his own:</p></b>
